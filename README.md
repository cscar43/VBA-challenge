# VBA-challenge
Where my module 2 homework is
Added in the macro for my working code.
I was not able to have the code auto fit the columns without using a seprate sub.
When it was part of my main sub of code it would crash my spreadsheet when i would run it
Also have screenshots of the 3 different tabs and all the information needed for the columns asked for
